I have created a function matchLunchEvent which takes an parameter(arr), the list of events.

First i have iterated through the array and created an hours array to find the time in hours

I have created divs for each event by mapping each to a div in hours array.

Used translateY to position the event div. Didn't get quite right.

Checking if the start times vary by more than 30 minutes,
if yes logging that no possibilities and turning border to black.

    else logging the companion array element to the console.
